            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Erika, a Junior Software Developer with a passion for problem-solving and bringing ideas to life
                through technology. My career journey began in health sciences, but my curiosity and love for innovation
                led me to pivot into tech. I joined a software development bootcamp where I sharpened my skills in
                programming languages like JavaScript and Java and discovered my knack for creating scalable and
                efficient solutions.

                I’ve had the chance to work on projects that push me to grow as a developer, building both front-end and
                back-end systems. I genuinely enjoy taking concepts and turning them into functional, user-friendly
                applications that make an impact.

                When I’m not coding, I’m likely exploring new technologies, diving into personal projects (such as this page!), or
                learning something new to stay ahead in the fast-moving tech world. Outside of work, you can find me
                hiking with my family or cooking, which keeps me balanced and inspired.

                I’d love to connect—whether it’s to collaborate, chat about the latest in tech, or share ideas. Let’s
                build something great together!</p>
