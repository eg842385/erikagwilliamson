            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Erika, a passionate and dedicated Junior Software Developer with a knack for
                problem-solving and innovation. With a background in computer science and a keen interest in technology,
                I've honed my skills in various programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, and Java. My
                journey in software development has been driven by a deep love for creating efficient and scalable
                solutions.

                As a Junior Software Developer, I've had the opportunity to work on exciting projects that challenge me
                to grow and improve. I'm proficient in both front-end and back-end development, and I enjoy the process
                of transforming ideas into functional and user-friendly applications.

                In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and
                continuously learning to keep up with the ever-evolving tech landscape. When I'm not coding, you can
                find me [mention a hobby or interest], which helps me stay inspired and balanced.

                Feel free to connect with me for collaborations, networking, or just to chat about the latest trends in
                technology. Let's create something amazing together!</p>
